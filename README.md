- They should be properly compressed and optimized (lossless is preferred) for use on the web.
- Interlaced is preferred (also known as progressive).
- Images with transparency is preferred.
- If multiple images are available, the ones optimized for a white background are preferred.
  - Transparent images can be prefixed with `transparent_`
